I appreciate all the the hospitality your team has extended to us. Thank you for all that you and your administration are doing to put &quot;America First,&quot; to protect our borders, and return investment to our great country. It&#39;s amazing what you have accomplished during your first year back in Office.</p><p>The announcement of the Freedom 250 Grand Prix was a big day for our country and for INDYCAR. It will certainly be a great celebration and will bring incredible economic value to Washington D.C. Thank you for your support in making this happen.</p><p>Thank you again for your continued leadership. I am proud to support</p><p>you and your administration. I look forward to seeing you again soon.</p><p>All the best&quot;</p>",
