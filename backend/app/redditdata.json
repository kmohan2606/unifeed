Its just mindboggling how you have the best shooter in the world and can&#39;t get him quality shooters around him. I don&#39;t know if you just get the right players around him or if there&#39;s nothing the Warriors can do.</p><p>It feels like the ship has sailed in Golden State and Steph would be better suited as a #2 on a contender. I feel he&#39;s almost in a similar situation as Klay where he has to choose his next move. He&#39;s got some heavy thinking to do because as much as he wants to retire as a Warrior I&#39;m certain he doesn&#39;t want to go out like this and just put up stats on a weak team.</p>",
